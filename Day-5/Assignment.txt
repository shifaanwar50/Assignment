3.  What is setInterval()  and setTimeout() methods in JavaScript?
ans-JavaScript SetTimeout and SetInterval are the only native function in JavaScript that is 
used to run code asynchronously, it means allowing the function to be executed immediately, 
there is no need to wait for the current execution completion, it will be for further execution.

4.  What are promises in JavaScript? Why do we use?  
ans - A JavaScript Promise object can be:
Pending
Fulfilled
Rejected
The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.
While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.
When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.
When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.

b-To manage asynchronous actions in JavaScript, promises are used. It is an assurance that something will be done.
The promise is used to keep track of whether the asynchronous event has been executed or not and determines what
happens after the event has occurred.
