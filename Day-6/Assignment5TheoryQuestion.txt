5. Find some details about following: 
a.How to hide html element using JavaScript?  jQuery? 
ans - jQuery hide() method is used to hide the selected element. It acts like the display: none property of CSS 
      and removes the selected element from the document. 
      In Javascript the visibility property is used to hide or show the content of HTML elements. The visibility
      property specifies that the element is currently visible on the page. The ‘hidden’ value can be used to hide 
      the element. This hides the element but does not remove the space taken by the element, unlike the display property.          
b.  How to select all textboxes using jQuery selector?  
    Hint : Without using classname / id
ans - All elements that do not match the given selector can be selected using jQuery( “:not(selector)” ).
c.  What is the difference between   "this" and  $(this) in jquery programming?
ans -In JavaScript, this keyword is used to refer to the object it belongs to. The value that this stores is the 
     current execution context of the JavaScript program.Thus, when used inside a function this value will change 
     depending on how that function is defined, how it is invoked and the default execution context whereas $(this)
     refers to the object it belongs to. Basically, both are the same. But when this keyword is used inside $(), 
     then it becomes a jQuery object, and now we can use all properties of jQuery on this method.
