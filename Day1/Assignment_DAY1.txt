3.  Test the following requirement using JavaScript

		a.  Create two separate *.js files (Names :  ClientScripts1.js, ClientScripts2.js)
		b.  Write some messages using alert() .  Message should contains the file name
		c.   Import the above js files in other *.html document and observe.

ans - index.html
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
      <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Document</title>
      <script src="./ClientScripts2.js"></script>
      <script src="./ClientScripts1.js"></script>
      </head>   
      </body>
      </html>
  
    ClientScripts1.js
    alert('Hello from first client(clientScript1.js)');
   
    ClientScripts2.js
    alert('Hello from Second client (clientScript2.js)');

observation - The js file which will be included first in the html will be the one whose alert box will be displayed first.Like if we are adding client
Script1.js before clientScript2.js then this alert box ('Hello from first client(clientScript1.js)') will be displayed first and after that second file 
alert box.

4.Do some changes and observe

		b.  Is  Filename case sensitive check practically?

ans - a - on giving different file names it's showing following messages
      *GET http://127.0.0.1:5500/Day-1/clientScri2.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)
      *index.html:1 Refused to execute script from 'http://127.0.0.1:5500/Day-1/clientScri2.js' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
      
      b- In javascript file name are not case sensitive because the language does not manage files directly.
