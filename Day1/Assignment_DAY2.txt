Execution Location: Runs on the user’s browser.
Purpose: Enhances and manipulates web pages and user interfaces.
Common Uses: Form validation, animations, interactive features, and handling user events.
Access: Cannot directly access databases or server-side resources.
Visibility: Source code is visible to the user.
Examples: Scripts that validate form inputs before submission, dynamic content updates without page reloads.
*- Server-Side JavaScript (SSJS)
Execution Location: Runs on the web server.
Purpose: Handles backend operations like database interactions, file system access, and server logic.
Common Uses: Processing user requests, accessing databases, performing calculations, and generating dynamic content.
Access: Can access server-side resources and databases.
Visibility: Source code is not visible to the user.
Examples: Node.js applications that handle API requests, server-side rendering of web pages.
